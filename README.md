# DuckDB HTTPFS extension

The httpfs extension is an autoloadable extension implementing a file system that allows reading remote/writing remote files. For plain HTTP(S), only file reading is supported. For object storage using the S3 API, the httpfs extension supports reading/writing/globbing files.

## Building & Loading the Extension

The DuckDB submodule must be initialized prior to building.
```bash
git submodule init
git pull --recurse-submodules
```

To build, type:
```
make setup-vcpkg
VCPKG_TOOLCHAIN_PATH=$pwd/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake GEN=ninja make
```
Consider adding `GEN=ninja` and having `ccache` installed to speed up recompilations.

### VCPKG
`vcpkg`, a package manager for C++, it's highly reccomended to generate reproducible and stable builds, in particular here it serves to build the `openssl` and `curl` dependencies.
Without the `VCPKG_TOOLCHAIN_PATH` option, locally available libraries will be used from default search paths.

## Running
The resulting binary, that will also statically link and load the `httfps`, it's available like:
```
./build/release/duckdb
```
```sql
FROM read_blob('https://duckdb.org/');
```

## Testing
Some tests querying remote resources can be run already without further setup:
```
./build/release/test/unittest
```
Further integration testing uses a local MinIO setup using Docker. See the [testing documentation for more information on how to set this up locally](test).

## Tracing DuckDB system calls

The repository includes a cross-platform tracing helper for running arbitrary
SQL against the local DuckDB shell:

```console
python3 scripts/trace_duckdb_syscalls.py \
  --duckdb build/release/duckdb \
  --scope process \
  --sql 'SELECT 42;'
```

macOS query/engine scope uses symbol-resolved DTrace probes; Linux process scope
uses `strace`. See [the tracing guide](scripts/trace_duckdb_syscalls.md) for
scope semantics, permissions, artifacts, security considerations, and tests.
